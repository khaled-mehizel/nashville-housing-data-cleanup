# Nashville Housing Data Cleanup
 A comprehensive cleanup of a very dirty dataset, purely in SQL.

# Overview
The data consitutes homes and homeowners in Nashville, TN, USA.

Definitely not the most interesting dataset but it serves the purpose to show my SQL skills, hopefully.

# Tools & Resources Used
 - Microsoft Excel for eyeballing the data, and exporting it as a .csv file.
 - Notepad++ and CSV Lint to convert the .csv file into a .sql script for quick import into MySQL Workbench.
 - MySQL Workbench for cleaning the dataset, as well as exporting it into a nice and clean DB ready to be queried for analysis.
